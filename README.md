# Detection-of-diabatic-or-non-diabetic-using-Logistic-regression
Early detection of diabetes is critical for preventing complications and improving patient outcomes. This project aims to build a binary classification model that predicts the likelihood of diabetes based on input features such as glucose levels, BMI, age, and more.

Technologies Used:
- Programming Language**: Python
- Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn
- Data Handling**: Pandas, NumPy
- Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Model Evaluation**: Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, ROC-AUC

- Logistic Regression is a supervised classification algorithm used for binary classification tasks. It outputs probabilities using the sigmoid function and applies a threshold (default = 0.5) to classify the output.

**Sigmoid Function:**
```math
Ïƒ(z) = 1 / (1 + e^-z)
